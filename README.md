#Pokedex Explorer
###Lab 7 at Alchemy Code Lab

This is an app made using vanilla JS that allows the user to browse through a table of Pokemon and their attributes. Users can search in order to filter the results based on the Pokemon's name, type, weight, attack, or height. If the letters inputted by the user are in the Pokemon's name, then those Pokemon will stay in the table...if the letters are not in the Pokemon's name, they will be filtered out. If a user searches by type, only the Pokemon's who have a matching type to the input will stay. For the attack, weight, and height, only the Pokemon with values greater than or equal to the inputted number will stay visible on the table.
